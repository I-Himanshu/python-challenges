"""
Define a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only parameter.

Your function should compute and return the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list.

For example, the call largest_difference([1, 2, 3]) should return 2 because 3 - 1 is 2.

You may assume that no numbers are smaller or larger than -100 and 100.
